# Tensium
Use Selenium and Machine Learning to figure out how to navigate a website.


# Why Tensium?

The aim of this project is to automate the automation process. Currently, while website testing can be efficiently tested using various automation tools, the writing of such tests can be difficult and time consuming. Tensiums' goal is to simplify this manual coding process to some simple inputs.

Let's automate the automation process using Artificial Intelligence. Tensium learns how to navigate your webpage.

Use the botebook to get started with an example / tutorial, or use the python code to start building test cases.
